    <p>Based on their skills and interests, participants select an unpaid, three-month-long internship position at Temple Hospital or Temple University Main Campus. During the year, they rotate through a total of three internships where they hone their skills, and determine which position would best fit their professional objectives.</p>

    <p>If at the end of the three internship rotation, a long-term position is not offered, the Employment Here and Now! program, in collaboration with the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation and other team members, will make a referral to another supported employment agency.</p>
