<h3>Projects</h3>

<h4>Smart Caption Glasses</h4>
<p>Smart Caption Glasses allow people who are Deaf or experience hearing loss to view captions at any performance, from any seat in the theater, using Open Access Smart Capture technology. The Institute is collaborating with People's Light theater in Chester County, Pennsylvania and the National Theatre of Great Britain, on a project that will bring this technology, developed by the National Theatre and Professor Andrew Lambourne, to the United States. The Smart Caption Glasses display a synchronized transcript of the play's dialogue and sound from the production directly onto the lenses of the smart glasses (manufactured by Epson).</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania alone, 1.1 million residents experience hearing loss, representing 8.58% of the Commonwealth's population. Most theaters only offer a handful of open captioned performances during the run of any given show.</p>

<p>Smart Caption Glasses make it possible for all performances to be captioned.</p>

<p>Theater goers in the Philadelphia area can experience the smart caption glasses during the 2019/20 season at People's Light, located in Malvern, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Smart Caption Glasses will be available to the general public in January, during People's Light production of The Children. They are free to patrons and can be reserved in advance or they may be requested on show day, but are subject to availability.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3ya9tnv8c">video demonstrates the Smart Captioning Glasses</a> at work.</p>

<p>In early October 2019, the Institute along with People's Light theater and the National Theatre, London, introduced Smart Caption Glass, a new technology to aid theater-goers who are deaf or hard of hearing. Philadelphia's <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/tech/Testing-Smart-Caption-Glasses-Theater_Philadelphia-563048772.html">local NBC affiliate covered the story</a> in its evening news broadcast.</p>

<p>On October 17, 2019, People Light theater hosted members of the press and select consumers to introduce the Smart Caption Glasses. Here are a few of the stories: <a href="https://6abc.com/community-events/smart-caption-glasses-allow-for-enhance-experience-for-people-with-disabilities-/5626433/">ABC 6 - People's Light theater's smart caption glasses allow for enhanced experience</a> for people with disabilities | <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/adapted-for-the-stage-glasses-that-stream-captions-in-real-time-improve-access-for-hearing-impaired/">WHYY News - Adapted for the stage: Glasses that stream captions in real time</a> improve access for hearing impaired</p>

<p>The Smart Caption Glasses project is made possible with generous support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, The Barra Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>

<h4>Discovering the Selinsgrove Center</h4>
<p>The Institute is engaged in a discovery project to illuminate the complex history of institutionalization through the personal experience of those who live it.</p>

<p>Many institutional residents do not communicate in a traditional method and their voices often go unheard. Artists may be uniquely positioned to gather and interpret their stories.</p>

<p>Working with a group of multidisciplinary artists and historians, the Institute will develop an arts-based methodology and artist residency program. During the year-long project, pilot residencies will be established on the grounds of Selinsgrove Center in central Pennsylvania, home to more than 220 people with intellectual disabilities.</p>

<p>Participating artists include oral historical Nicki Pombier Berger, public historian Donna Graves, dancer KC Chun-Manning, and documentary photographer Ruddy Roye. Funded by the Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage.</p>

<h4>Visionaries Are Made</h4>
<p>Visionaries Are Made is a series of portraits of mothers and fathers. None would describe themselves as visionaries yet, as parents of a child with a disability, each was transformed from parent to advocate. To parent a child with disabilities means teaching the world to see possibility not limitation and to be a persistent, committed risk taker for a cause they believe in. The parents in these photos prove that visionaries are not born. Visionaries are made.</p>
