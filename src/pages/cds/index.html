    <P>The College of Direct Support (CDS) is an online curriculum designed for those who support people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The courses are presented by DirectCourse, and the CDS is administered in Pennsylvania by the Institute on Disabilities at Temple University.</P>

    <P>The CDS connects the direct support workforce with a recognized, standardized set of skills to help improve job satisfaction, increase performance and reduce turnover.</P>

    <P>The evidence-based curriculum was created more than 10 years ago by the University of Minnesota's <a href="https://ici.umn.edu/projects/6">Research and Training Center on Community Living</a>.</P>

    <P>The online education model has proven effective for user, in part because of the 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week accessibility. Along with the accessibility and the curriculum, the testing and tracking tools delivered by Elsevier Performance Manager make the College of Direct Support today's leading platform for direct support education.</P>
