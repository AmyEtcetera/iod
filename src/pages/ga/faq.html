    <h3>Answers</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><a id="q1"></a>Applications for graduate assistant positions are accepted throughout the year but particularly sought in the spring semester. The student must already be accepted to a full-time graduate program at Temple University.</li>
        <li><a id="q2"></a>Most graduate assistantship positions begin in September with the start of the fall semester. Occasionally, students are hired in January to begin with the spring semester.</li>
        <li><a id="q3"></a>The number of graduate assistants hired ranges from 12 &ndash; 15 per year. The number of new students hired depends upon the number of returning students and the number of new graduate assistantship  positions.</li>
        <li><a id="q4"></a>Students receive a stipend that is paid from the specific grant-funded program of the
            Institute on Disabilities. Tuition remission is awarded as a scholarship from the Graduate School of Temple            University.</li>
        <li><a id="q5"></a>All applications are reviewed by the assistantship coordinator upon receipt. Students           are selected for a first interview with the assistantship coordinator based on a match between the needs of the
            work assignment and the students' skills, abilities, academic department and interests.</li>
        <li><a  id="q6"></a>During the interview, the assistantship coordinator will explain the assistantship           program in detail and will ask the student to discuss their work experience and interests. At the end of the            interview, the assistantship coordinator will advise the student of any specific graduate assistantship            positions that might be a good match to the studentâ€™s skills, experience, academic department and interests.        </li>
        <li><a  id="q7"></a>If after the first interview with the assistantship coordinator a possible match is            identified to a specific graduate assistantship position, the student will be scheduled for an interview with            the actual work assignment supervisor. The assistantship coordinator will attend all subsequent interviews.</li>
        <li><a id="q8"></a>Generally, two or three students are recommended for an interview with a work
            assignment supervisor.</li>
        <li><a id="q9"></a>Yes, a student may be recommended for more than one specific assistantship position.
        </li>
        <li><a id="q10"></a>Interviews are scheduled in the late spring and continue through the summer. Other         interviews are scheduled throughout the year as new graduate assistantship positions become available.</li>
        <li><a id="q11"></a>Yes, you will need to come to Philadelphia for an interview with the assistantship            coordinator and for subsequent interviews with work assignment supervisors if selected. Interviews can be         scheduled during already planned visits to campus and the Philadelphia area.</li>
        <li><a id="q12"></a>Graduate assistantships are awarded in late spring and throughout the summer.            Occasionally, positions are awarded within the first few weeks of the fall semester.</li>
