          <p>On May 4, 2019, the Department of Labor & Industry published a Notice in the PA Bulletin announcing its intent to close the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation (OVR) Order of Selection (OOS). OVR is the state vocational rehabilitation agency. Its mission is to assist Pennsylvanians with disabilities to enter, regain, or retain employment. The OOS is the manner in which OVR prioritizes cases so that individuals with the most significant disabilities receive services first. Closure of the OOS means that OVR will stop accepting new applications for services.<br>
